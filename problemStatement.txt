Hackathon Challenge: The "Social Saver"
Bot
Theme: Turning Your Instagram Saves into a Knowledge Base.
1. Executive Summary
We all do it: you're scrolling through Instagram, you see a Reel with a great workout routine, a
design tip, or a coding hack. You hit "Save," but you never look at it again. It gets buried in a
hidden folder, lost forever.
The Mission: Build a WhatsApp Bot that fixes this.
Your task is to build a bot that takes the Instagram links (and other social links) you send it,
automatically understands them, and saves them to a personal website.
2. The Core Problem
Information on social media is fleeting.
● Instagram: Great for visual inspiration, but impossible to search.
● WhatsApp: Where we actually chat and share things, but it's not a storage tool.
The Challenge:
Create a system where a user can simply forward an Instagram link to a WhatsApp Bot,
and the system automatically:
1. Reads the link.
2. Extracts the caption or vibe.
3. Saves it to a clean, searchable dashboard.
3. The Pipeline (Keep It Simple)
You don't need enterprise code. You just need to connect the dots.
A. The Inputs (Primary Focus: Instagram)
1. Instagram Links (The Star): The bot should accept a Reel or Post URL.
○ Challenge: Can you extract the caption? Can you get the hashtags?
2. Twitter (X) Threads: The bot should save the text from a Tweet.
3. Blogs/Articles: The bot should save the title and main text.
B. The Interface (WhatsApp)

● The User Experience: The user shouldn't have to download a new app. They should just
text their "Bot Number" on WhatsApp.
● The Interaction:
○ User: Sends https://instagram.com/p/xyz...
○ Bot: "Got it! Saved to your 'Design' bucket."
C. The Intelligence (AI)
Once the link is received, your backend should use a simple AI (like OpenAI, Gemini, or
HuggingFace) to:
● Auto-Tag: Is this "Fitness," "Coding," "Food," or "Travel"?
● Summarize: Write a 1-sentence summary of the caption.
D. The Output (The Dashboard)
Build a simple web page (Cards layout) that displays the saved content.
● Visuals: Show the Instagram link (embed it if you can!) and the AI summary.
● Search: Let the user type "Pasta" and find that recipe Reel they saved 2 weeks ago.
4. Technology Stack (Open Ended)
You have total freedom. Use the tools you know best.
● Bot Interface: WhatsApp (Twilio Sandbox, Meta API, or any Python library). Telegram is
allowed as a backup if WhatsApp is too hard.
● Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI), Node.js, or No-Code tools.
● AI/LLM: OpenAI API, Gemini, Claude, or open-source models.
● Database: Firebase, MongoDB, SQLite, or Google Sheets.
5. Evaluation Criteria
We are judging your creativity and functionality.
1. The "WhatsApp -> Insta" Flow (40%)
○ If I forward a Reel to your bot, does it actually end up on the website?
○ Does the bot reply to me?
2. AI Smarts (30%)
○ Did the AI correctly guess the category (e.g., tagging a workout video as "Fitness")?
3. User Experience (20%)
○ Is the dashboard clean?
○ Is it easy to find old links?
4. The "Wow" Factor (10%)
○ Did you figure out how to embed the video player?
○ Did you add a "Random Inspiration" button?

Deliverables:
1. A working demo (Screen recording of you sending a link on WhatsApp and it appearing
on the web).
2. A link to your code repository.
3. A simple diagram showing how you connected WhatsApp to your Database.
